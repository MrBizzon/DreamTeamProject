I started playing in October-November 2010, I liked the game and the excitement appeared. The game was delayed, I gave all my free time to the game sometimes to the detriment of my family. And so it happened. I began to notice that someone sometimes uses accom. On the game forum, everyone is advised to contact the help@tanki onlain support service, which I did after describing the essence of the problem. In the reply letter, I received a request to answer questions about the account in order to confirm that it is mine.
